        I am fascinated by the future. I anticipate and imagine in detail what
        tomorrow could or should be. I usually see the future positively. I
        continuously strive to learn and improve. Learning is just as important
        to me as the knowledge I gain. My passion and life's work is to create a
        better world where people work with passion, meaning, and purpose while
        actively supported by an inspiring community and ecosystem.
